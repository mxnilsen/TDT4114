        face (int): The face value of the card, which must be an integer between 1 and 13.
    Methods:
        __init__(suit, face):
            Initializes the PlayingCard with a suit and a face value.
        get_as_string():
            Returns the string representation of the card in the format "suitface".
        get_suit():
            Returns the suit of the card.
        get_face():
            Returns the face value of the card.
        __eq__(other):
            Checks if this card is equal to another card based on suit and face value.
        __hash__():
            Returns the hash value of the card based on its suit and face value.
